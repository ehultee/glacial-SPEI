A version of SPEI where we have replaced the glacier runoff in the 
"with runoff" SPEI equation with (percent glaciated)*(1.5)*(precipitation).  This is used
as a basis of comparison to explore a point raised by a reviewer re: non-glacial-derived
increase in SPEI due to differences in precipitation-elevation scaling between GCMs and 
the model of Huss & Hock.  

See ESD Discussions for more details.
